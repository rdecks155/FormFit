A squat is a seemingly simple movement, but can cause injury if done incorrectly. All
levels of fitness can be improved by supporting squat form. This program has been created to
identify an individual’s squat form and provide feedback on imperfections of the squat. The
program is designed to check the angle of thigh to calf to ensure full muscle activation. In
addition, the program would monitor the heel of the individual to recognize any sign of
imbalance. In summary this program will give binary, yes or no, feedback; either, approving or
disapproving an individual’s squat form.
